> musi Wate pi toki Inli.

[Wordy](https://wordy.maciej.ie) is an open source clone of
[Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).
Play it at [wordy.maciej.ie](https://wordy.maciej.ie).

Wordy is based on my project [Wate](https://github.com/maciej-irl/wate) -
a Toki Pona version of Wordle. This repository's only job is to automatically
clone Wate, configure it use English words, then deploy it to a different domain
than its Toki Pona counterpart. Submit any issues or PRs to
[maciej-irl/Wate](https://github.com/maciej-irl/wate).
